# Hybrid Quantum Classical Neural Network for radar data

This is an ongoing work, built upon and based on the work done in the [repository CANSOFCOM](https://github.com/SinclairHudson/CANSOFCOM).

We want to classify drones based on the RADAR signals using convolutional neural networks. And then extend it to classify drone using a hybrid quantum classical Neural Networks. We also then use these models for radar detection.
