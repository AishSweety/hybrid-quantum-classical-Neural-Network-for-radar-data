# Hybrid Quantum Classical Neural Network for radar data

We want to classify drones based on RADAR signals using convolutional neural networks and using hybrid quantum neural networks. We also create a classical annd hybrid quantum model for binary classification for radar detection.

### Data Generation
The dataset of STFT spectrograms are generated based on the Martin-Mulgrew model [1] in ``` DattaGeneration.ipynb ```.
