# Hybrid Quantum Classical Neural Network for radar data

This is an ongoing work repository, built upon and based on the work done in the [repository CANSOFCOM](https://github.com/SinclairHudson/CANSOFCOM).

We want to classify drones based on RADAR signals using convolutional neural networks. And then extend it to classify drones using hybrid quantum classical neural networks.
