# Hybrid Quantum Classical Neural Network for radar data

This is an ongoing work repository. We want to classify drones based on RADAR signals using convolutional neural networks. And then extend it to classify drones using hybrid quantum classical neural networks. We also create a model for binary classification for radar detection.
